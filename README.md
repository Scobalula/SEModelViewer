SEModelViewer is a tool that allows you to view SEModel files, it was primarly made as a way to easily view models exported by [Wraith](http://aviacreations.com/wraith/) but can work on any valid SEModel files.

## How to Use 

Using SEModelViewer is very easy, to use SEModelViewer you can either load a folder of models by clicking File>Import Folder or load a single model/specific models by clicking File>Import SEModels, the folder load method will parse all subdirectories, if loading a Wraith export, just select the "xmodels" folder as the folder to use. While models are loading you're free to view other models, but some parts of the application may be disabled while models are loading.

With models loaded you can click a model and use the arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through models, you can also disable texture loading to increase model load speeds.

If you'd like to export models, you can use either use File>Export Select or File>Export All.
