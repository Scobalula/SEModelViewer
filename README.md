SEModelViewer is a tool that allows you to view SEModel files, it was primarly made as a way to easily view models exported by [Wraith](http://aviacreations.com/wraith/) but can work on any valid SEModel files.

## How to Use 

Using SEModelViewer is very easy, to use SEModelViewer you can either load a folder of models by clicking "Load Folder" or load a single model by clicking "Load SEModel", the folder load method will parse all subdirectories, if loading a Wraith export, just select the "xmodels" folder as the folder to use.

## Support Me

If you use SEModelViewer in any of your projects, it would be appreciated if you provide credit for its use, a lot of time and work went into developing it and a simple credit isn't too much to ask for.
